Trump.“We have reached the final stage in preparations to   an intercontinental ballistic rocket,” he said.Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months, taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea.Mr. Kim’s speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may   a   rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program, said Cheong   a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea.The first of such tests could come even before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Cheong said.“We need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year’s speech where Kim   mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile,” he said.In his speech, Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. Trump’s election.It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile.In April, North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile.” On Sept. 9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test.Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new   rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible.In November, the United Nations Security Council imposed new  sanctions against the North.\n",

Out of the city’s 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan, according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data.. “It’s the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan,” said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part “because that’s where the money is.. ” Sergeant LoPuzzo, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department.\n",

      " With friends, including the   artist Benji Okubo, he founded the Oriental Artists’ Group of Los Angeles, which organized exhibitions of members’ work  —   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time.. Artistic recognition, when Mr. Wong did find it, was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation, professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman.. ” After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Mr. Wong, like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage, lest an angry American beat him up on the street.. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, curated in part by Ms. See, was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles.\n",

      " And this time Abe Vigoda, of the “Godfather” movies and “Barney Miller,” actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had.. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz.. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball’s first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if?\n",

      " At the time, Mr. Kim said the North “can tip   intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth, including the U. S. mainland, within our striking range.. If North Korea conducts a    test in coming months, it will test Mr. Trump’s new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions, North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kim’s professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States.. But analysts in the region said the North’s launchings of   rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles.. He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea.\n",

      " LONDON  —   Queen Elizabeth II, who has been battling a cold for more than a week, missed a New Year’s Day church service at her country estate in Sandringham, Buckingham Palace said on Sunday.. The queen, who ascended to the throne in 1952, became the world’s   monarch following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October.. “The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold,” the palace said in a statement.. The queen’s husband, Prince Philip, who had also been ill, was well enough to attend both services, in the church at Sandringham, which is in Norfolk, on the east coast of England.\n",

      " ” Ms. Tsai’s vision, however, “may not align well with the incoming Trump administration’s apparent belief that it can pressure China on all fronts more than the Obama administration has,” he said.. “She remains calm, rational and patient,” Ms. Glaser wrote in an email.. “We will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,” she said.. Despite Beijing’s recent actions, which she said had “hurt the feelings” of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation.\n",

      " If he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal, he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more.. ” “It is not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of us experience as we age are the consequences of changes in lifestyle, the environment or just the biology of aging,” Dr. Rosenbaum added.. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight.. Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, an obesity researcher at Columbia University who has collaborated with Dr. Hall in previous studies, said the body’s systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss.\n",

      " On Dec. 10, 125 friends and relatives gathered in Palm Springs, Calif. at the Colony Palms Hotel, which was opened in 1936 by the reputed mobster Al Wertheimer and whose poolside guests have included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Kirk Douglas and Zsa Zsa Gabor.. That is when Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr moved into the ambiguous “mixtape era,” in which for months they emailed and texted each other with coy “are we just friends or what” texts revolving around music.. Ms. Kerr grew up in the La Jolla section of San Diego, graduated from the University of Southern California in 2000 and eventually made her way to New York, where she took a job as an assistant at Elle magazine.. In answering the usual     questions, Mr. Leahy told her he was a music supervisor for “Girls,” the HBO show created by and starring Lena Dunham.\n",

      " But Jesus had school bills to pay, and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for José Sr. ’s mother, who died over the summer, and things began to unravel.. As José and Zoraida Muñiz and their children have struggled to deal with a   series of trials and setbacks, including cancer, debilitating epilepsy, deep depression and near eviction, it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together.. Jesus is returning to college, where he is on a   track and wants to be a paramedic.. ” All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives, or picked up off the street, just like all the furniture in the Muñizes’ overstuffed apartment in a   complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, much of it restored by Ms. Muñiz.\n"

    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Automatic text summarization is one of the most intersting topics in NLP which has an impact in our everyday lives. The motivation of this project is to summarize all the important information from an article to help us decide if the whole article is worth reading. Now instead of just skimming a huge article we can read the automated summary with the most important features included. Text summarization in general is categorised into Abstractvie summarization and Extractive summarization. We have choosen to implement two extractive summarization algorithms which are based on the techniques of sentence extraction. We attempt to identify the set of sentences that are most important for the understanding of a given article. There are many techniques available for Extractive summarization, so to keep it simple we are using unsupervised learning approachs. In this project we are creating article summaries using two different unsupervised algorithms.The intention of using two different algorithm is to evaluate the model's summary and identify which algorithm provides a better summary compared to the other and in what ways.\n",
    "1. Word Frequency algorithm - Sentence score based on Term frequency algorithm. \n",
    "2. Cosine similarity algorithm - Sentence score based on TextRank algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATA: \n",
    "\n",
    ">Articles1.csv is the dataset we have picked from Kaggle \"All the News\" for summarizing articles in the content field of the dataset. This Dataset has a total of 53291 articles from which we have tested our code for 100 to 2000 articles. However the final model generates summaries for up to 10 articles. The articles in the dataset are of varying lengths which made the process of summarizing every article a bit tough. Since both our models are based on extracting sentences based on the scores, the uneven sized article made it difficult to keep constant threshold. For evaluation purposes we have split the data into even sized articles (of a descent length...not too short) and generated summaries for them using both our models. Evaluation is explained in the end of the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model 1- WordFrequency Algorithm - Sentence Score using Term Frequency : \n",
    ">A mathematical approach to extract sentences based on their scores. Below are the steps we take:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the dataset csv file for content row which has all the articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a frequency table for the list of words in the article- ignoring stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sentence tokenize each article and store as a list of sentences \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scoring the sentences based on Term Frequency Method. In brief, scoring a sentence by its words, adding together the frequency of every non-stop word in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Find the threshold, which will be used later to determine which sentences will be included in our summary. In this stage we define an article's average sentence score as it's threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Generate summary by selecting the top ranked sentences from our sentence score dictionary. If the sentence scores are greater than the threshold or average score (adjusted with a multiplier), then return the sentences and stack them up together as a single summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works?\n",
    ">We have created 4 functions to extract a summary for N number of articles in our dataset (Articles.csv). Below are detailed explanations of how each function in our model works. We use an example article taken from the dataset(article 5). This shows step by step how the final summary is being generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Original Article: \n",
    "__LONDON _ Queen Elizabeth II, who has been battling a cold for more than a week, missed a New Years Day church service at her country estate in Sandringham, Buckingham Palace said on Sunday. A week earlier, the queen, who is 90, missed a Christmas Day church service, for the first time since 1988, because of the illness.\"The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold” the palace said in a statement. The queen's husband, Prince Philip, who had also been ill, was well enough to attend both services, in the church at Sandringham, which is in Norfolk, on the east coast of England. The queen, who ascended to the throne in 1952, became the worlda's   monarch following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October. She is also Britaina's   monarch, having last year surpassed Queen Victoria's  reign. Her mother lived until the age of 101.__\n",
    "\n",
    "###### __create_freq_table:__ \n",
    ">This function creates a frequency table dictionary that holds the frequency of all the words in an article. The words are normalized using word_tokenize, and porter stemmer algorithm to count the frequency of stem words.

For each sentence in an article word count of the sentence is stored in a variable. For each word in the wordfreqTable dictionary, if the word is present in the sentence add the freq count of word into sentenceScore dictionary.A potential issue with our scoring algorithm is that the longer sentences will have advantage over shorter sentences. To resolve this, we are dividing every sentence score by the number of words in the sentence, to make scoring fair. We have used sentence [:15] which is the first 15 characters of any sentence, this is to save memory overhead while making dictionary easier to read.

If the sentence's score is above the threshold argument (which is multiplied by a variable 1.2 or any value of our choice) it is included in the summary. The higher the value you multiply the threshold by the smaller your summary will be since threshold is higher. Feel like a multiplier of 1.3 - 1.7 returns a good length summary, depending on the length of original article. If article is short like article[5] it is hard to return a summary that doesn’t include all or most of the 6 sentence article (summary generated with threshold *1.5 returned the whole article). Also some summaries read better when they are shorter, while others make more sense given a few extra sentences. We don’t want it to be too short but also don’t want it to be too long. Feel like 3-6 sentences is a good length range on average. But again due to the varying sized articles we found it hard to find a universal threshold that was ideal for all cases. Because of that and other issues dealing with evaluation, we decided to only run our evaluation on evenly lengthed articles that were of a descent size (not too short like article[5])\n",

The handwritten summary was mostly extractive (using sentences from the original article) with a few minor exceptions and alterations to try to keep the evaluation somewhat fair (since both of our models are extractive).

    "> Because of the high prevalance of human judges choosing hand written summaries for most of their guesses, we decided to further evaluate using the same setup with the same article's headlines followed by the same three summaries: M1, M2 and HW. We asked our new set of judges to not only guess which headline's summary they thought was the best (most likely hand written and easiest to read and follow) we also asked them to choose which was the worst (hardest to understand and follow, and most likely not hand written), basically ranking them from best to worst. This way even if they choose HW as the being the best as most judges did, we can still easily compare our two models to one another directly. The chart below shows out of Model 1 (M1) and Model 2 (M2), which summary was choosen over the other as being better (easier to follow and understand and more likely hand written summary).\n",

    "> Neither model seems to outperform the other by a significant amount. Seems to depend on the article and the judge. Overall neither model performed that well, compared to a human. Most of the issues seems to be due to the extractive nature of the algorithms. For instance large_arts[0] model 1 summary begins like this; __By midmorning, Mr. Trump had weighed in, questioning the members’ priorities on Twitter. Minutes later, members emerged to say the changes had been scrapped.__ What _changes_ are they refering to and what _members_ of what? This isn't clear to the reader. Even though these sentences scored high, stacked together without syntax they don't make sense.The handwritten summaries we used for evaluation purposes can be found in the attached csv file (which also contains summaries for 100 articles from our original uneven article list generated by both models). The computer generated summaries used for our evaluation will output in the below code. We used a threshold multiplier of 1.3, and model 2 summary was 4 sentences long."

This was not the first time that House lawmakers  —   Democrats or Republicans  —   had tried to curtail the powers or budget of the Office of Congressional Ethics, which some lawmakers see as being too aggressive in its investigations, even though it is routinely cheered by nonprofit ethics groups on both the left and the right.\n",

    ">In search of creating a better summary we have created two working algorithms that generate summaries for N number of articles. Model 1 (Term Frequency) scores sentences based on the word count. Model 2 (cosine similarity) scores the sentences based on sentence similarity. Based on our observation both models have their share of good and bad summaries generated. This can be due the extractive technique used in our models and uneven articles lengths in our dataset. An Evaluation to validate which model's summaries are better was performed, to compare human written summaries with both model’s run on for evenly sized articles. We had judges who have no experience in the field decide which summary seemed best based on the article's headline. Unfortunately, neither model seems to outperform the other by a significant amount. Results seem to depend on the article and the judge. Overall neither model performed that well, compared to a human. Most of the issue with both of our models revolve around ambiguity issues. Seems like this might be a common issue with any extractive summarization model. It is hard to create a good summary from an article simply by extracting sentences from it and combining them into a summary. This is since the sentences must go together and make sense. Abstractive summarization could be a possible solution to resolve these ambiguity issues. However there are many techniques in NLP and a lot of research needs to be done to understand all the summarization techniques to conclude one model is the better than other."
